# Installation
Before anything else, install the dependencies:
```sh
yarn install
```

or for those who prefer `npm`:
```sh
npm install
```

# Configuration
After installing the dependencies, it's time for a quick configuration.

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

```sh
cp .env_example .env
```
 
Add and replace values where needed:

```
#
# Discord bot token
#
BOT_TOKEN=<the bot token you are going to use>

#
# The channel to where generic messages (Hello/Goodbye) should be sent
#
MAIN_CHANNEL_ID=<the id of the Discord channel you want to use>

#
# Time (in seconds) the bot should ignore requests from users
#
MSG_THROTTLE_TIME=30

#
# The number of retries before sending a direct message to insistent users
#
MSG_RETRY_THRESHOLD=3
```

# Running
If you went through the previous steps successfully, you should now be able to run **Pepe as a Service**â„¢ with the following command:
 
```sh
node src/app.js
```

You should see an output similar to this:
```sh
READY :: Pepe-As-A-Service started @ 2019-2-27 21:27:00
```

That's it!
